As the semester was plagued by the arrival of SARS-COV-2, leading to school being moved to remote only,
development was made much more difficult. In order to mitigate our inability to work face-to-face, most
of the assets were passed back and forth through Discord, rather than using version control. This was a
decision made so that it would be easier to get everything working together in the long run.

## Game

The game itself is simple: You are a monster; destroy the city. The idea was originally pitched to
include other aspects as well, including a story -- but this is all we had time for given the
circumstances.

## Controls

The controls follow a traditional WASD scheme to move around, with left-click to attack buildings.
